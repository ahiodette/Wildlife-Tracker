<h1>WILDLIFE TRACKER</h1>
        <h4>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. We must conserve these species and protect their habitats. This application helps Rangers to record those animals according to whichever status they are.  </h4>
